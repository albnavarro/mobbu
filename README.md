### Development environment for:
- `mobCore`: store & generic utils.
- `mobJs`: component library.
- `mobMotion`: animation library.

### Goal:
- `Distraction-free` and `zero-dependencies` development.
- Use `dependencies` only for `editor tool` and create `bundle`.
- Ability to `focus` exclusively on my code.


note:
`highlight.js` It is the only library used to show syntax in code snippets. It's a good compromise, it's just a background library that has no bearing on the logic of the entire project, and it can be deleted at any time.


## Node version:
v23.5.0

## Installing:
