### Development environment for:
- `mobCore`: store & generic utils.
- `mobJs`: component library.
- `mobMotion`: animation library.

My general approach to things comes from `DIY` (do it yourself) culture. In this field, my foundations lie in `graphics`, `writing`, and `frontend development`. On a non-professional level, I operate in the realm of simplification and the intersection of various disciplines which led to the creation of this repository.

## The key points are:

### Serverless:
A `serverless` approach, as `simple` as possible, which is why I needed a system based on an `SPA` (single-page application). Local `JSON fetches are instantaneous`, and since I'm not concerned with search engines or metrics, even a hash-based navigation system suits my needs.

### No Dependencies:
**Complete control over the system**.<br/> Years ago, I chose not to use dependencies outside of professional work. In this project, there’s only one dependency: a syntax-highlighting library for code snippets, which is absolutely marginal and an acceptable compromise.

### Maintainability:
The system must be maintainable over time, beyond fleeting trends. I don’t know how the most renowned libraries work under the hood, so I followed what seemed the most logical path. This choice to remain impervious to trends ensures the system doesn’t age compared to others. By creating a modular and simple system with the right tools (static code analysis), keeping the code updated requires minimal effort.<br/>
**Keep in mind that significant advancements in browser APIs and the language itself are very slow and never destructive**. This ecosystem stability is the foundation that keeps me from going crazy chasing the latest trendy JavaScript library.<br/> I reinvent the wheel and refine it over time.

### JsDoc:
To stay as true as possible to the language in its purest form, I use typing via `JsDoc` and `.d.ts.` It may have limitations compared to `.ts`, but for my needs, it’s more than enough.

### Closing Thoughts:
This certainly took a lot of energy (we’re talking years of development), but at the same time, it allowed me to grow passionate and learn many pure abstractions that apply to a broader scope than just a single framework. Now that the system—though still improvable (potentially a perpetual work-in-progress)—has taken clear shape, the curve is descending, and I can reap all its benefits.
